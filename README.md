# In this project, I analyzed a dataset that tracks every single Major League Baseball player's individual statistics every season from 1973 through 2020. I fit different types of machine learning models to my data to find which model could best predict whether a player, given his other statistics, will hit at least 20 home runs in an individual season. I also found which statistics are most indiciative of a player's propensity to hit at least 20 home runs in a season. This is an extension of a previous Exploratory Data Analysis project that used the same dataset and can also be found on my GitHub.
